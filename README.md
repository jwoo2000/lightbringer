# Project 2 Report

Read the [project 2
specification](https://github.com/feit-comp30019/project-2-specification) for
details on what needs to be covered here. You may modify this template as you see fit, but please
keep the same general structure and headings.

Remember that you must also continue to maintain the Game Design Document (GDD)
in the `GDD.md` file (as discussed in the specification). We've provided a
placeholder for it [here](GDD.md).

## Evaluation Plan

### Evaluation Techniques

#### Observational technique

The observation should be a mostly uninterrupted playthrough with the player giving their thoughts on the game after they have played. 
If the player gets stuck or does not understand the controls, the interviewer can help out but should note down how they helped out.

Watch the player play the game for 2 - 5 minutes and take note on the following:

Does the player have a good understanding of the controls, were they easy to understand?
What upgrades did the player pick or tend to prefer? (Are they balanced or are the other upgrades not providing a meaningful impact on the gameplay).
Did they easily understand how the level up system works and how to gain exp, and did they intuitively understand which fireflies gave more exp.
Were the enemies' difficulties suited for their intended purpose? i.e are the small enemies easiest to deal with, etc.
What did they struggle with?
What did they understand well?
Did anything unexpected happen?

The aim of the observation is to take note of unexpected player behaviour and play patterns. This could include, places players get stuck on, quality of life features that would help benefit the player or they expected to be included, any bugs they have found.

#### Questionnaire/survey

Give this survey to the participant after they have had a chance to play the games and allow them to submit their answers anonymously.
The survey results should be used to measure the ease of use of the game. It will measure how easy it was to understand and use the controls.

##### Questions 

What is their age? Provide the age as a range and not an exact value for anonymity
What is their gender?
Do they play games on a regular basis?

Please answer the next questions as a scale of 1 - 10 (1 - not true at all, and 10 being completely true)

I thoroughly enjoyed the game.
I found the controls intuitive.
I found the player controls to be cumbersome.
I felt comfortable using the controls.
I learned the controls quickly.
The controls were similar to other games I have played.
I needed to learn the controls well before I could play.
Adapting to the controls was difficult.
The controls felt unnecessarily complex.
I found the controls to be inconsistent.

The following questions are open ended

What did you like about the game?
What didn’t you like about the game?
What would you like to see added to the game?
Is there anything that you would remove from the game and if so what would you remove and why?

### Participants

We should aim to have a large majority of our participants be in our target demographic of casual gamers in a 15 - 25 age range. Participants must remain anonymous. Participants outside of the demographic are ok and can be useful to gauge if we could have a potentially wider target audience.

Each team member should aim for at least 3 participants of the target audience, and at least 5 participants in total.

### Data Collection

#### Conducting the data collection:

Data collection should be done with the interviewer having a full view of the game screen while the participant is playing. This can be done in person or through an online streaming of the game. The interviewer should be able to talk to the participant via in-person or through an online call.

#### Ensuring equal and accurate results:

The participants should all playtest the exact same version of the game. To ensure this occurs, the playtests will be done in a set period of time on the main branch of the project. During this testing period there should be no updates made to the main project branch.

#### What will be used to collect results:

The results for the observational technique should be written or typed and then compiled with other results.
The survey questions will be put into an online form that the participants can fill out and submit anonymously.

### Data analysis

The results of the survey should have a SUS score calculated to determine how much of a change we will need to make. A low score will indicate a large improvement to quality of the games controls needs to be made and a high score will indicate that the game’s controls are well tuned.
The survey provides open ended questions about what the participants would like to see added to the game. This would be a good starting point to see if there are any similar answers and if they would be well suited for our game. Similarly for things that the participants didn’t like about the game, if there are enough similar answers then we should consider making an adjustment and removing that feature from the game.

### Timeline

The tests must all be conducted over the course of one week. During this time no changes should be made to the Main project branch and all tests should be conducted off of the main project branch. After this week is up or after each team member has collected all of their results we will make changes to the project as necessary.

### Responsibilities

Each team member will be responsible for collecting at least 5 participants each. Of these participants 3 must be within our target demographic of 15 - 25 year olds that are currently casual gamers.
